## Developed with Brownie UI Library

🍫 **Brownie**: [Jetpack Compose UI Library](https://github.com/sergio11/brownie_ui_library) 🚀

Brownie is a 🌟 Jetpack Compose library module that provides a set of pre-defined components to accelerate the development of Android interfaces and applications. It is designed to help developers apply best practices in screen state management and utilize the most effective design patterns in their projects.

### Features 🎉

- **Pre-defined Components**: Brownie offers a variety of ready-to-use components, from buttons to lists and cards, to facilitate the creation of attractive and consistent user interfaces.
- **State Management**: Facilitates screen state management by implementing patterns such as MVI (Model-View-Intent) or MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).
- **Customization**: Brownie components are highly customizable and can easily adapt to the visual style of any application.
- **Jetpack Compose Compatibility**: Fully integrated with Jetpack Compose, the modern Android UI library, to ensure optimal performance and a smooth development experience.

### Model-View-Intent (MVI) Architecture 🏗️

Brownie encourages the use of the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture pattern for effective screen state management. In this pattern:

- **Model**: Represents the state of the UI. Brownie provides a `BrownieViewModel` class that extends from `ViewModel` and handles the UI state.
- **View**: Renders the UI based on the state provided by the ViewModel. Brownie components are seamlessly integrated with Compose to create a declarative UI.
- **Intent**: Represents user actions or events that trigger state changes. Brownie's components, like buttons and text fields, are designed to emit these intents efficiently.

This setup leverages Brownie's components and ViewModel to accelerate the development of robust features while adhering to best practices in architecture and UI design.

For more information, check out the [Brownie UI Library on GitHub](https://github.com/sergio11/brownie_ui_library) and give it a ⭐ star to show your support!

## 🌟 Seamless User Experience

I have focused on providing a seamless user experience by leveraging cutting-edge Android technologies. Jetpack Compose enables me to create a responsive and visually appealing interface that adapts to various screen sizes and orientations. Integration with Jetpack components ensures smooth data synchronization, reliable background tasks, and efficient navigation flows, resulting in a fluid and enjoyable user experience.

## 🔒 Security at Its Core

Security is at the heart of VaultKeeper. I implement industry best practices in cryptographic algorithms and key management to ensure your data is always protected. My use of Clean Architecture and the MVVM design pattern ensures the codebase is organized, maintainable, and easily testable, translating into a more secure and reliable application.

##  🏗️ Clean Architecture
VaultKeeper employs Clean Architecture principles to ensure the app is scalable, maintainable, and testable. Clean Architecture separates the code into distinct layers, each with clear responsibilities:

* **🎨 Presentation Layer:** Built with Jetpack Compose, this layer handles the UI and user interactions. It communicates with the ViewModel to retrieve data and update the UI reactively.
* **💡 Domain Layer:** The core of the application, containing business logic and application rules. It includes use cases that orchestrate the flow of data to and from the presentation and data layers.
* **🗄️ Data Layer:** Responsible for data management, this layer includes repositories that abstract the data sources, whether they are local (Room database) or remote (Firestore).

## 📊 Data Sources

VaultKeeper ensures data persistence and security using a combination of local and remote data sources:

* **📂 Local Data Source (Room):** Room is used to cache debit card information locally. The data is encrypted using advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure security, even if the device is compromised.
* **☁️ Remote Data Source (Firestore):** Firestore serves as the remote data repository, ensuring data is not lost even if the app is uninstalled. Firestore provides real-time data synchronization and offline support.

## 🛡️ Cryptographic Techniques
To protect user data, VaultKeeper implements robust cryptographic practices:

* **🔑 Master Key and Salt:** Each user's data is encrypted with a unique master key and salt, which are generated programmatically and stored securely in Firestore.
* **🔐 Data Encryption:** All sensitive information, including passwords and banking details, is encrypted using the master key and salt.
* **🗝️ Application Master Key:** The master keys and salts are encrypted using the application's master key. This key is stored in a secure .so file, accessible via Java NDK, preventing extraction through decompilation.

##    🔏 Key Storage

The .so file containing the application's master key ensures that the key cannot be easily extracted by attackers, enhancing the security of the encryption keys stored in Firestore.
